// a) buggy my _read implementation ?

// All the actual chunk generation logic needs to be
// *below* the call to _read.  The reason is that in certain
// synthetic stream cases, such as passthrough streams, _read
// may be a completely synchronous operation which may change
// the state of the read buffer, providing enough data when
// before there was *not* enough.
//
// So, the steps are:
// 1. Figure out what the state of things will be after we do
// a read from the buffer.
//
// 2. If that resulting state will trigger a _read, then call _read.
// Note that this may be asynchronous, or synchronous.  Yes, it is
// deeply ugly to write APIs this way, but that still doesn't mean
// that the Readable class should behave improperly, as streams are
// designed to be sync/async agnostic.
// Take note if the _read call is sync or async (ie, if the read call
// has returned yet), so that we know whether or not it's safe to emit
// 'readable' etc.
//
// 3. Actually pull the requested chunks out of the buffer and return.
